## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a Code of Conduct that all contributors are expected to follow. Please read [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ruby 3.3.6
- Rails 7.1.3
- SQLite3
- Node.js (for asset compilation)
- Git

### Setup Development Environment
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Hyperpolymath/candy-crash.git
cd candy-crash

# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Setup database
rails db:create db:migrate db:seed

# Run tests
rspec

# Start development server
rails server
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
3. **Write tests** for new functionality
4. **Update documentation** as needed
5. **Run the test suite** and ensure all tests pass
6. **Submit a pull request**

### Branch Naming Convention
- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring
- `test/description` - Test additions/improvements

## Coding Standards

### Ruby Style Guide
We follow the [Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/) with these conventions:

- **Indentation**: 2 spaces (no tabs)
- **Line length**: 120 characters maximum
- **Method length**: Keep methods under 10 lines when possible
- **Class length**: Keep classes focused and under 100 lines

### Rails Conventions
- Keep controllers thin, models fat
- Use service objects for complex business logic
- Follow RESTful routing conventions
- Use strong parameters for security
- Write self-documenting code with clear naming

### Code Quality Tools
```bash
# Run RuboCop for style checking
rubocop

# Auto-fix violations
rubocop -a

# Run Brakeman for security analysis
brakeman

# Check for vulnerable dependencies
bundle audit check
```

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage
- All new features must include tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Test both happy paths and error cases

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
rspec

# Run specific test file
rspec spec/models/user_spec.rb

# Run with coverage report
COVERAGE=true rspec
```

### Test Structure
- **Unit tests**: Test individual methods and classes
- **Integration tests**: Test component interactions
- **Request tests**: Test HTTP endpoints
- **System tests**: Test user workflows (optional)

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `refactor`: Code restructuring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Example:**
```
feat(courses): Add course search functionality

Implement ransack-based search allowing users to filter
courses by title, category, and difficulty level.

Closes #123
```

### Commit Best Practices
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- First line max 50 characters
- Body wrapped at 72 characters
- Reference issues and PRs when relevant

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting
- [ ] All tests pass (`rspec`)
- [ ] Code passes linting (`rubocop`)
- [ ] Security scan passes (`brakeman`)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated (for significant changes)
- [ ] Database migrations tested both up and down

### PR Template
```markdown
## Description
Brief description of changes

## Type of Change
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Breaking change
- [ ] Documentation update

## Testing
How has this been tested?

## Checklist
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Self-review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
```

### Review Process
1. **Automated checks** must pass (CI/CD pipeline)
2. **At least one maintainer** must approve
3. **Security review** required for auth/authorization changes
4. **Performance impact** assessed for database/query changes

### Merge Strategy
- We use **squash and merge** for feature branches
- Maintain **linear history** on main branch
- Delete branch after merge

## Security Vulnerabilities

**Never** report security issues via public GitHub issues.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for responsible disclosure procedures.

## Recognition

Contributors are recognized in:
- Git commit history
- CHANGELOG.md for significant contributions
- README.md contributors section (optional)
- Annual contributor appreciation (if applicable)

## Questions?

- Open a **Discussion** for general questions
- **Issue tracker** for bugs and feature requests
